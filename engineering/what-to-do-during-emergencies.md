We've recently experienced a DDoS attack, but an emergency can also be a faulty code change or unexpected downtime (Vercel, AWS, ...)

1. Keep a cool head
2. Gather as much information and open a thread in Twist, title: "Critical: XYZ"
3. Research the best expert (see Area of Expertise: [https://cal.com/open](https://cal.com/open))
4. If you are an expert, expect to drop whatever you are doing right now
   1. If you are working on an equally important ticket or are OOO, find another expert
   2. If youâ€™re unsure of which task has more priority, contact Bailey, Peer, CiarÃ¡n or Zomars
5. Once we identified the root cause, update the [cal.com-status-page.md](cal.com-status-page.md "mention") and inform leadership to post on Twitter and Slack
6. Keep the Twist thread up-to-date on all steps that have been taken, so other people know what to search for
   1. i.e.: "Database not affected, just checked the logs"
   2. i.e.: "Vercel is reporting a downtime, see https://vercel-status.com"
   3. i.e: "I can reproduce the issue locally, I am now rolling-back our last commit"
7. If you are approaching end-of-the-day and the problem is still ongoing, find a new expert and explain what steps you would've tried next
8. Keep a cool head. This too shall pass.
