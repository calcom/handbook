# Data fetching

When fetching for data in your Next.js pages you can follow the recommended approach for handling prefetching and loading states:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

This will allow to have this data already ready in the initial load, reducing the number of loading states and null/undefined checks.
