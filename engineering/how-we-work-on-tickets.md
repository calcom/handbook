# üíª How we work on Tickets

### Linear and SyncLinear.com

We use [linear.app](https://linear.app) for all issue tracking and use [synclinear.com](https://synclinear.com), our self-made Linear üîÑ GitHub Sync tool to 1-to-1 sync tickets.

> This app lets you mirror Linear tickets to public GitHub issues, comments and all. This way, open-source teams can chat with contributors without giving access to an internal Linear team.

By default, every ticket from Linear will be sent to GitHub and comments and statuses will be synced back and forth.

Non-team members such as open-source contributors can continue to create tickets on [Github](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues) and Cal.com Core members can assign the label "linear" to sync it back into Linear.

The roadmap will continue to be public: [cal.com/roadmap](https://cal.com/roadmap).

We run on a monthly tagged release schedule with a weekly minor release each Monday.

For tracking milestones, we use Linear Projects (v.2.2, v.2.3, etc.).
