# üåù Deploying to Production

We merge all reviewed and approved PR's to `main` and then merge to the `production` branch to start the automated deployment process.&#x20;

| Branch        | Deployed         | Envirorment |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Pull Requests | \*cal.vercel.app | Preview     |

### Check for migrations

This is important. When doing a release make sure you run proper migrations first.

Also, important sidenote, if a migration is adding a new table. We need to re-grant proper permissions to each created username that are currently being used. Run these commands for each username (Replcing \<USERNAME> with the proper one):

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO <USERNAME>;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <USERNAME>;
```
