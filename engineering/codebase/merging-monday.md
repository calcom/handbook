# üåù Merging (Monday)

We merge all reviewed and approved PR's automatically to main, but then on monday we will cherry-pick from main and deploy to `production` branch. This ensures we have time to catch any bugs or missing stuff during the whole week at staging (cal.dev)

| Branch         | Deployed         | Envirorment |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| main           | app.cal.dev      | Staging     |
| production     | app.cal.com      | Production  |
| Pull Request's | \*cal.vercel.app | Preview     |
