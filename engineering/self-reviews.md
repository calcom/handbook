A guide to PR self-reviews
{% endembed %}

## Key points

* Use the changed files tab to ensure the diff looks correct, and that there are no unintended changes added onto your PR
* Use the review feature to add GitHub comments in the diff, so that other engineers can understand your PR more easily
* Make sure you assign a few reviewers once you are complete

### Examples

* If the Tailwind formatter changed the order of a ton of classes in the code as part of your PR, adding a review comment letting the other engineers that this is an automated reorder of classes and that you didn't add/modify any classes yourself
* Explain caveats and drawbacks of your solution
