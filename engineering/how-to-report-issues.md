# 🐛 How to report issues

_always_ create a GitHub ticket first unless it’s

* a severe security concern or
* a bug that is user-specific / includes user information / doesn’t require code changes

1. create the ticket in GitHub
2. add all the labels (bug, etc.)
3. open a thread with the same name + post the link + tag the right person (check [Areas of Expertise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gl6cO28rTXFNUlvLw2S4tmm1lcmliQ-rumEBVW06HKs/edit#gid=0) to find your expert)
4. If no clear expert or expert busy, post as “LFE: \<title of issue>” (Looking For Engineer) in Twist\
