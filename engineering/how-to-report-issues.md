# üêõ How to report issues

_**Always**_ create a Linear ticket first unless it‚Äôs

* a severe security concern or
* a bug that is user-specific / includes user information / doesn‚Äôt require code changes

1. Create the issue in **Linear**
   * At this point, it should go into **Triage**. From there, the **Product** team will triage the issue, decide its priority and will plan it to be worked.
   * If the issue is a urgent bug that we need to fix now, it can be **Accepted** and put directly into **In Progress**
     * Ensure you've correctly set the **Project** on the Linear issue to correspond with the current release we are working on (e.g. v3.6, v3.7, etc.)
   * If it's more an internal task we don't want the GitHub community to see, put the `private` label on the issue so it's not synced.
   * There have been many Linear/GitHub issues created with just a link to Threads. **We need to stop doing this since community members do not have access to Threads.**
2. Add all the labels (bug, etc.)
3. Only open a thread if the issue is **Urgent** and we need to coordinate the work immediately.
   * Otherwise, new threads should not be created in the normal course of working issues.
   * Let's try to keep discussions about how to implement a feature or bug in Linear/GitHub. This will provide more content on the project itself instead of hidden in Threads.
