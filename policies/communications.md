# ðŸ—£ Communications

We use threads.com and gitbook.com for communications.

Threads.com has:

* <mark style="color:purple;">**threads**</mark> and
* <mark style="color:red;">**group messages**</mark> (#General and #Engineering, potentially #Operations and #Marketing later)
* <mark style="color:green;">**direct messages**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**GitBook**</mark> has:&#x20;

* long-form entries and playbooks

### Here's how to know what to use:

* **things that are only relevant for today** => <mark style="color:red;">**group message**</mark> in #General / #Engineering
  * Example: "hey ESLint is breaking for me, can someone help?"&#x20;
* **things that are for a week up to a month** => <mark style="color:purple;">**thread**</mark>
  * Example: RFCs, Bug Reports, Sales Notes, ...
* **things that are only relevant for one person** => <mark style="color:green;">**direct messages**</mark>
  * Example: "Hey can you book my link for peer programming?"
* **things that are relevant forever and future hires** => <mark style="color:blue;">**GitBook**</mark>
  * Example: This entry
