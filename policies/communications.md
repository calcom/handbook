# ðŸ—£ Communications

We use threads.com and gitbook.com for communications.

Threads.com has:

* <mark style="color:purple;">**threads**</mark> and
* <mark style="color:red;">**group messages**</mark> (#General and #Engineering, potentially #Operations and #Marketing later)
* <mark style="color:green;">**direct messages**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**GitBook**</mark> has:&#x20;

* long-form entries and playbooks

### Here's how to know what to use:

* **things that are only relevant for today** => <mark style="color:red;">**group message**</mark> in #General / #Engineering
  * Example: "hey ESLint is breaking for me, can someone help?"&#x20;
* **things that are for a week up to a month** => <mark style="color:purple;">**thread**</mark> (see below for etiquette)
  * Example: RFCs, Bug Reports, Sales Notes, ...
* **things that are only relevant for one person** => <mark style="color:green;">**direct messages**</mark>
  * Example: "Hey can you book my link for peer programming?"
* **things that are relevant forever and future hires** => <mark style="color:blue;">**GitBook**</mark>
  * Example: This entry

### The "Thread Police"

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

One thing we've adopted company-wide is the "Thread Police" ðŸš“ðŸš“ðŸš“ðŸš“  essentially when a conversation either goes out-of-topic or is too sync-heavy (i.e. too many people chiming in, too many different opinions etc.) we move things into an async thread.&#x20;

Threads are more structured and less noisy, async friendly and easier to follow up at a later time.

Every employee in the team is empowered to share the "Thread Police" emojis :police\_car::police\_car::police\_car: when they feel like something gets out of hand in a group chat.

Anyone who keeps talking about this topic in the sync chat afterwards goes to async-jail immediately, you do not pass Go and do not collect $200.



### Threads Best Practices



#### Using Blocks

Using blocks allows others to reply to specific ideas and/or sections of a thread instead of a large piece of text. Simply hit "enter" to add more blocks. See the example below:
