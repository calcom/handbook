# üèñ Vacations

We‚Äôve tried to make our PTO policy as simple as possible. If you‚Äôre in a part-time role, contact Peer or Bailey to find out more. We insist that you take your full amount of vacation days!

| Type                      | Days per year | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Personal Days (full time) | 30            | Paid in full. Additional days unpaid. |
| Public holidays           | 7             | See list below.                       |
| Sick days                 | as you need   | Paid in full.                         |

### Recognized Public Holidays

* Martin Luther King Day
* Memorial Day
* Independence Day
* Labor Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* Christmas Day
* New Years Day

## Key points

1. Never feel bad for taking time off for being sick, spending time with your family, or any other priority in your life. This is what PTO is for, so make sure you use it :)
2. Post your OOO in the standups channel with as much notice as possible (if necessary, mention what projects are open and if you need help from someone)
3. Set your Threads status to "üö´ OOO" to inform your colleagues, and mark yourself OOO as an event in the team calendar
4. Keep track of your OOO days in a spreadsheet or note-taking app for yourself
5. We'll occasionally ask you if you've taken any days off as a reminder
6. Please be mindful of not taking PTO during a high-priority project or immediately after a launch (in case you are needed for debugging). If you do have to be away, then please ensure all knowledge is transferred to someone else in the team so they can effectively cover your position.
7. We work much like a sports team, and like every other sports team during a game, you can temporarily substitute yourself with another team member, whether you‚Äôre going to be away, if you‚Äôre struggling or for anything else



## How to Vacation

1. Add to Team Calendar and Copy to Personal Calendar
2. Put yourself as OOO in Threads
3. Create a Vacation Auto-Responder (email)
4. Check with team members in your department on responsibilities that need to be taken care of.

### OOO for Only One Day&#x20;

If you're out for part of a day, you don't need to block out the specific time in the team calendar (feel free to do so in your personal calendars if you're trying to block meetings). Other notes when going out for the day:&#x20;

1. No need to report anything that's less than three hours&#x20;
2. No need for a reason, unless it's absolutely necessary
3. Feel free to use Thread's OOO feature to put your notifications on "do not disturb"

## Vacation accrual

<summary><strong>Will my unused vacation days carry over to the following year?</strong></summary>

Unused days _can_ be carried over into the following year. While we encourage you to get out of the office and refresh, we won't penalize you for showing up to work üòâ

<summary><strong>As a new employee, will my vacation days be prorated?</strong></summary>

Yes. The number of personal days will be adjusted based on your start date. Sick days and holidays will not be affected.
