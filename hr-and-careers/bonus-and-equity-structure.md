#### **Equity Retainers**

**Definition:** Equity retainers represent a portion of company ownership or stock that is provided to employees as a reward and incentive.

**Our Approach:** We believe in rewarding those who have committed their time, effort, and expertise to our company. Our equity retainers are not just random handouts; they're a reflection of your loyalty and continuity within the company.

1. **Time-Based Allocation:** The longer you are with us, the higher your equity retainer. Your retainer will be calculated based on the cumulative time you spend with the company. This is to ensure that those who have been with us through thick and thin, weathering the ups and downs, are aptly rewarded.
2. **Periodic Evaluation:** We conduct reviews at our discretion of all equity retainers to ensure that they are in line with our company's objectives and your personal contribution.

#### **Payout**

**Definition:** Payout refers to a special financial reward given to employees when the company achieves a specific revenue milestone.

**Our Approach:** Success is sweeter when celebrated together. Every time we achieve a significant revenue milestone, we recognize and reward those who have played a pivotal role in reaching that goal.

1. **Celebration of Success:** Revenue milestones are a testament to our collective hard work. To mark these achievements, we distribute a payout to our top performers.
2. **Periodic Evaluation:** Our leadership team will periodically evaluate our revenue targets and the associated payouts to ensure that they are competitive and reflect the company's trajectory and market conditions.

#### **Payrise**

**Definition:** A payrise is an increase in an employee's regular salary, typically awarded for exceptional performance or as part of a periodic review.

**Our Approach:** We believe in recognizing and compensating talent appropriately. Payrises in our company are a reflection of your commitment, talent, and contribution to our shared goals.

1. **Performance-Based Increments:** Your performance is the primary criterion for receiving a payrise. We conduct regular performance reviews, and those who consistently meet or exceed expectations are considered for salary increments.
2. **Bi-annual Reviews:** Every employee will have a bi-annual salary review where their pay, performance, and potential future contributions are assessed.
3. **Market Competitiveness:** Apart from performance, we also periodically review our salary structures in relation to market standards. This ensures that our pay scales are competitive and that we continue to attract and retain the best talent.
