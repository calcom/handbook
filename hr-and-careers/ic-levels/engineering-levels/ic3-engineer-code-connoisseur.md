* **Responsibilities**:
  * Handle and solve complex backend logic tasks.
  * Plan, build and maintain complex features.
  * Tackle technical debt to help the team build more efficiently.
  * Be a mentor to your teammates. When they are stuck, you should proactively help them push work to completion.
  * Ensure application uptime and be the primary point of contact during application downtimes. (DevOps realm)
  * Oversee and manage the build pipeline and database structures. (DevOps realm)
* **Learning:**&#x20;
  * IC3 engineers should now start learning about how to help other engineers be more productive.&#x20;
  * They should actively research new technologies, architectural and design patterns, examine trade-offs for long-term technical decisions.
* **Expertise**:&#x20;
  * IC3s possess top-tier TypeScript knowledge and know our code very deeply.
  * They are specialists in timezone logic, Prisma and our deployments.&#x20;
  * They are often called upon for tasks that require deep technical expertise and understanding.
  * Their code is clean, tested and easily extended.
* **Path to IC4:**
  * **Typical timeframe**
    * 1-3 years
    * You need to consistently demonstrate skills of an IC4 in order to be promoted.
    * You do **not** need to work on **Foundation** team to move to IC4.
  * **Lead complex initiatives**
    * Take ownership of complex, company-wide technical initiatives, and demonstrate your ability to plan, lead, and successfully deliver them.
      * Example: Our production database is in us-east-2 but our serverless functions are in us-east-1, causing a system-wide reduction in performance. What do we do?
  * **Mentorship and leadership**
    * Continue to mentor and coach engineers at all levels, but also become more involved in actively sharing your expertise with a wider audience.
      * Example: Share books you've been reading, post interesting threads about new technologies, explain in detail a recent technical decision you've made and why.
