# üèÜ IC Levels

When you work at Cal.com, you will have an assigned **IC level**. These are often posted in our job listings and can be found on the employee list at cal.com/open.

IC levels range from 1 to 4, and determine the pay band and responsibilities you have within the company.

One of the reasons behind clearly defined pay bands is that **we pay everyone equally**, no matter where they come from or any other demographics. For this reason, **we don't allow salary negotiation** or individual 'deals' when it comes to employment and instead stand firmly behind equal pay.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:**

Somebody who's doing the same job as you in India whilst you are in San Francisco does not mean that the person from India should be paid less than you because they have a lower cost of living. Hence, if you're on the same IC band, then you're compensated the same both in salary and equity as anyone else in your band.
