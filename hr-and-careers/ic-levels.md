# üèÜ IC Levels

When you work at Cal.com, you will have an assigned **IC level**. These are often posted in our job listings and can be found on the employee list at cal.com/open.

IC levels range from 1 to 4, and determine the pay band and set of responsibilities that you have within the company.

One of the reasons behind clearly defined pay bands is that **we pay everyone equally**, no matter where they come from or any other demographics. For this reason, **we don't allow salary negotiation** or individual 'deals' when it comes to employment and instead stand firmly behind equal pay.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:**

Somebody who's doing the same job as you in India whilst you are in San Francisco does not mean that the person from India should be paid less than you because they have a lower cost of living. Hence, if you're on the same IC band, then you're compensated the same both in salary and equity as anyone else in your band.
{% endhint %}

A common misconception with IC levels here is that people expect that they should aim to move up to the highest band because then that means they're the best. This is not correct, as IC bands are based on responsibilities in the team. Higher IC bands usually consist of more management-related responsibilities, whereas lower levels focus more on roles that are fully occupied with things like engineering and less management, documentation, or anything else.

As a result of this, we encourage you to look at what each IC band means and consider whether you would prefer a role where you can focus on getting code written, or if you want to move up to higher levels, where you'll then be expected to manage others on the team, research, document and more.

**IC levels do not determine the complexity of code that you work on.** Although higher IC levels tend to focus on the more foundational code, lower IC levels have an equal opportunity to work on core or complex parts of the code, but there is less of a responsibility to document and maintain it.

* **Level 1** - The most hands-on level. Focus on shipping features and bug fixes, and only worry about a few PR reviews when you are requested.
* **Level 2** - This level provides you with a mix of working on the product hands-on, with a greater focus on stability and working on foundational features, rather than IC1 which is mainly about shipping code. Here you will be expected to take part in RFCs and PR reviews and have much greater involvement in the code specification and review cycle.
* **Level 3** - This is a role where you are responsible for the build and deployment cycle, database health, fixing things if something goes wrong, and working on the really deep, foundational level tasks.
* **Level 4** - IC4 is a team lead, who is someone that ships core code changes, tackles big projects and leads the team to success with pull request reviews and support. It is also a more management-driven role that consists of managing the whole team, leading the direction of the company and the product, and creating change institutionally.
